# BlessingHands
 As the Lead Developer for the Blessing Hands Elder Care & Nursing Academy web application, I spearheaded the development of a robust platform designed to streamline caregiver registration, course management, and online booking. Utilizing JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap, I was responsible for both front-end and back-end development, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. Key contributions included implementing secure user authentication, efficient course registration processes, and thorough testing to meet client specifications. The result was a streamlined, user-centric platform that significantly enhanced the academy's online presence and facilitated a smoother caregiver hiring process.
